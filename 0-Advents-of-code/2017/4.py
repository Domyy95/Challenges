"""Problem 1
A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?
"""

"""Problem 2
For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

For example:

abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.
Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?
